Description:
The API endpoint responsible for deleting an employee successfully 
returns a 200 OK status code. However, when performing a subsequent GET request 
to validate the user no longer exists, the server incorrectly returns a 200 OK status code 
instead of the expected 404 Not Found status code.

Steps to Reproduce:
Send a DELETE request to the following API endpoint to delete an existing user:

URL: https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees/{userID}
Method: DELETE
Example userID: 1945d706-39f3-49eb-bea8-98abcf766e5e
Confirm that the deletion request is successful, returning a 200 OK status code.

Send a GET request to verify that the deleted user no longer exists:

URL: https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees/{userID}
Method: GET
Example userID: 1945d706-39f3-49eb-bea8-98abcf766e5e

Expected Result:
The server should return a 404 Not Found status code, indicating that the user has been deleted 
and no longer exists in the database.

Actual Result:
The server returns a 200 OK status code, incorrectly indicating that the user still exists, 
even though the user has been deleted.

Impact:
This issue creates confusion during automated API testing and manual validation, as it falsely 
confirms the presence of a deleted resource. It also violates standard REST API conventions, 
where a 404 response is expected when attempting to retrieve a non-existent resource.
Ensure proper handling of deleted resources and fix the incorrect status code to align with REST API best practices.

Environment:
API URL: https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees
Method: DELETE / GET
UserID Example: 1945d706-39f3-49eb-bea8-98abcf766e5e
