Description:
The UI allows the creation of a new employee when only a single character is entered for first name
and last name inputs. While it is acceptable to allow names with accents or special characters, 
the system should not permit first or last names that are just a single letter or digit. 
This validation issue could lead to improper data being saved in the system.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to application
2. Click 'Add Employee' button
3. Enter a single character (e.g., "A" or "." - or any other symbol) in the First Name input.
4. Enter a single character (e.g., "B" or "." - or any other symbol) in the Last Name input.
5. Fill out any other required fields (e.g., dependents) and click Add button.

Expected Result:
The system should not allow submission with only a single character in the First Name and Last Name fields.
An error message should be displayed indicating that the name must be longer than a single character
(e.g., "First name and last name must contain at least 2 characters").

Actual Result:
The system allows the creation of a new employee with single-character names 
(e.g., "A" for first name, "B" for last name). No validation error is triggered,
and the user is successfully created in the system.

Impact:
This issue allows invalid employee names to be entered into the system, which can lead 
to inaccurate data and complications during employee management. Proper validation should be 
in place to prevent such short, potentially erroneous names.
