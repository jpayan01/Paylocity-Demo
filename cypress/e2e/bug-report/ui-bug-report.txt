Bug Title: Incorrect First and Last Name display on employee Dashboard
after Adding Employee

Description:
When a user adds a new employee, the first and last name fields are swapped on the
employee dashboard. Specifically, after filling out the first name and last name inputs
and clicking the "Add" button, the newly added employee is displayed in the dashboard
with the first name shown under the "Last Name" column and the last name shown
under the "First Name" column.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button.
3. In the Add Employee modal, fill out the following fields:
4. First Name: (e.g., "Bruce")
5. Last Name: (e.g., "Wayne")
6. Dependents: 1 (or any other number)
7. Click the "Add" button to submit the form.
8. Observe the dashboard where the newly added employee is displayed.

Expected Result:
The First Name should appear in the "First Name" column.
The Last Name should appear in the "Last Name" column.

Actual Result:
The First Name is displayed in the "Last Name" column.
The Last Name is displayed in the "First Name" column.

Impact:
This issue creates confusion for users trying to view employee details from the dashboard,
as it causes incorrect labeling of employee names. This can lead to data inconsistency
and errors in employee management.

Bug Title: Lack of Validation Message for '0' Dependents When Adding a New Employee

Description:
When a user adds a new employee and enters '0' as the number of dependents,
the system allows the entry without providing any validation message or clarification
on whether dependents are required. The UI does not indicate if having at least one
dependent is mandatory, or if '0' is an acceptable value. This creates confusion for the
user about whether the "Dependents" field is optional or has a minimum requirement.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button.
3. In the Add Employee modal, fill out the following fields:
4. First Name: (e.g., "John")
5. Last Name: (e.g., "Doe")
6. Dependents: Enter '0'.
7. Click the "Add" button to submit the form.
8. Observe that the employee is successfully added with '0' dependents,
without any validation or clarification on whether '0' dependents is acceptable.

Expected Result:
The system should display a clear validation message explaining whether '0' dependents are
allowed or if at least one dependent is required. If dependents are mandatory, an error
message should be shown (e.g., "Please enter at least one dependent"). If '0' dependents
is acceptable, the UI should provide clarification (e.g., "It is allowed to have no
dependents").

Actual Result:
The system allows the user to submit the form with '0' dependents without any validation
or clarification on whether dependents are required. No feedback or error messages are
provided to guide the user on valid input.

Impact:
This lack of clear messaging causes confusion for the user about the dependents field.
It could lead to incorrect data entry if the system is intended to enforce a minimum
number of dependents, or leaves users unsure about what values are valid for this field.

Bug Title: Invalid Employee Creation with Single Character First and Last Names

Description:
The UI allows the creation of a new employee when only a single character is entered for first name
and last name inputs. While it is acceptable to allow names with accents or special characters, 
the system should not permit first or last names that are just a single letter or digit. 
This validation issue could lead to improper data being saved in the system.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to application
2. Click 'Add Employee' button
3. Enter a single character (e.g., "A" or "." - or any other symbol) in the First Name input.
4. Enter a single character (e.g., "B" or "." - or any other symbol) in the Last Name input.
5. Fill out any other required fields (e.g., dependents) and click Add button.

Expected Result:
The system should not allow submission with only a single character in the First Name and Last Name fields.
An error message should be displayed indicating that the name must be longer than a single character
(e.g., "First name and last name must contain at least 2 characters").

Actual Result:
The system allows the creation of a new employee with single-character names 
(e.g., "A" for first name, "B" for last name). No validation error is triggered,
and the user is successfully created in the system.

Impact:
This issue allows invalid employee names to be entered into the system, which can lead 
to inaccurate data and complications during employee management. Proper validation should
be in place to prevent such short, potentially erroneous names.

Bug Title: UI Layout Breaks When Adding Employee with Maximum Character Length for First Name and Last Name

Description:
When a user adds a new employee and enters the maximum allowable number of characters for both the First Name
and Last Name fields, the UI layout breaks after the employee is added. Specifically, the table columns shrink,
causing elements to become misaligned, and some parts of the UI appear 'offset'. This disrupts the display and
readability of employee data on the dashboard page.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard.
2. Click the "Add Employee" button.
3. In the Add Employee modal, fill out the following fields:
 > First Name: Enter a long string, such as "AutomationTesterTesterTesterTesterTesterTester".
 > Last Name: Enter a long string, such as "TesterTesterTesterTesterTesterTesterTester".
4. Fill in Dependents: Any valid number (e.g., 1).
5. Click the "Add" button to submit the form.
6. Observe how the UI is displayed after the new employee is added to the dashboard.

Expected Result:
The table columns should adjust dynamically or provide a mechanism (like text wrapping or truncation)
to handle long names without affecting the overall UI layout. The table columns should remain aligned,
and no elements should appear offset.

Actual Result:
The table columns shrink, causing the first and last name fields to overflow, which misaligns other columns.
Some UI elements, including the Actions column, are misaligned and pushed out of place.

Impact:
This issue significantly reduces the usability and readability of the employee dashboard page when handling
names with the maximum character limit, making it difficult for users to view and interact with the data.
